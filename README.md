# Interactive 3D Scenes with Three.js

This repository contains a series of projects where I explore 3D interactions using Three.js, focusing on implementing interactive features like selecting and interacting with objects within a 3D scene using raycasting.

## Project Goals

- Learn and experiment with Three.js for creating dynamic 3D scenes.
- Implement interactive object selection and manipulation through raycasting.
- Explore various techniques to enhance the user experience in a 3D environment.
